*__| 04/11 | bisexual | any pronouns | viet-eng | enfp | lowercase | free sitting |__*

> mostly bllk – gi/hsr/hi3 areas, free sitting but please whisper to interact cuz if you see me sitting alone, it means im afk – offtab. (*and i dont want to be cuddled by a stranger, dont act too close or ill have to kick your ass out*)

> any pronouns but i prefer he/him (im actually a male). 

> i get mad easily, my jealous ass cant even handle itself so be careful if you want to talk about my favorite person. but dont worry, at least overreacting is not my problem to struggle with: i wont be shouting at you.
